1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

   The most interesting topic we covered in my domain this quarter was about the models that can be used for text classification and how our work as students compares to those in the industry. We covered simple models like logistic regression and went towards more complex models like neural networks and LLMs, but it was very interesting to see that the solutions we landed on as students were the same solutions that our mentors used.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For my Quarter 2 project, I would want to investigate patterns in transaction history for people with higher risk of defaulting on a loan and for those with lower risk. This would consist of patterns related to transaction category, payment recurrence, payment amount, etc. These are important to developing accurate and equitable models that correctly classify individuals as high or low risk while being fair to everyone.

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make would be to test different models in a more structured manner. We have tested many different models and noted metrics for all them, but we could still improve on documentating all the different hyperparameters that underlie the model and our currrent metrics of success. Implementing logging in our model training and spending our time more efficiently (by doing feature cleaning or some interesting EDA) would level up our project.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

One technique I would be interested in using in our project are N-grams for feature generation built on the memos in our transactions dataset. We have currently been experimenting with TF-IDF built on single words, but including bigrams, trigrams, etc. would be interesting to test. Although not relevant to the model development side of the project, when creating the report/website, I want to make the site interactive in a way that users can input their own memos or history and our model would be able work with that data.
